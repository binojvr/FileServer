Unfortunately due to new year and arrival of my family I could not spend much on weekends this assignment. I have spent 6-7 hrs for client project  and 5 hours on server project. I have spent more time on client project because this is first time I workng client command line tool.

Following items I am still working and will be published by end of next week (I am working on weekends for thsi assignment) 

- Proving correctness of the code (and ensuring future code changes donâ€™t break CLI
/ Server interaction)
- CLI design, and ease of use
- Project tooling and reproducible builds (what tooling or checks would you need in
place in an OSS project, for example)
- Installation (how would you distribute the software to a user)
